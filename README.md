ðŸŒ± AI-Generated Plant Caring Game (Three.js)

This small web-based plant caring game was created as an experiment using Claude Sonnet 4, an AI assistant, to explore its capabilities in generating interactive 3D web content with Three.js.
The majority of the code in this project was generated by AI, but many tweaks were needed because there was a lot of confusion in object transformations. Project is an experiment to test and showcase what modern AI tools can build.
